Traffic Data Warehouse (WIP)
A Mini Data Engineering Project using SQL & Analytical Modeling

---
📌 Overview

This project is a Traffic Data Warehouse designed to demonstrate core Data Engineering, SQL, and Analytical Processing concepts.
It simulates how real-world traffic systems collect, clean, store, and analyze high-volume data for insights and decision-making.

The aim is to build an end-to-end analytical environment that includes:
Data ingestion
Data cleaning & preprocessing
Dimensional modeling (Fact & Dimension tables)
OLAP-style analytical queries
Future integration with Power BI / Tableau

---
Project Objectives

Design a clean, well-structured SQL data warehouse
Transform raw traffic logs into analytical-ready tables
Implement ETL logic inside SQL
Perform traffic analytics using optimized SQL queries
Enable dashboarding tools to consume processed data


---
Tech Stack

MySQL / SQL
Data Modeling (Fact & Dimension Tables)
ETL Concepts
Analytical SQL
Power BI / Tableau (Upcoming)

Completed Work

Designed database schema (staging + warehouse tables)
Cleaned and standardized raw traffic data
Created dimension tables (Date, Location, Vehicle, etc.)
Built fact table for traffic events
Implemented analytical SQL queries
Added indexing strategies for performance

---
Work in Progress

Building a modular ETL pipeline
Designing dashboards (Power BI / Tableau)
Adding automated reporting layer
Uploading sample datasets for reproducibility

---
Sample Analytical Queries

Peak traffic hours
Most congested routes
Vehicle-type distribution
Day vs Night traffic comparison
Location-based aggregation and patterns

---
 Future Enhancements

Real-time ingestion pipeline (Kafka or simulated)
More warehouse layers (Staging → ODS → DW)
Integration with cloud data storage
Time-series forecasting models
